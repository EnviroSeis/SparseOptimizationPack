These codes are written with cuda library and cusp package 
for matrix-vector operations

to compile, setup cuda library and cusp library. 
cusp directory should be inside cuda include dir.
(i.e. /usr/local/cuda-6.0/include/cusp)

source vars (modify per your system):
$ source setup_vars.sh

compile (add any optimization or system specific compile flags):
$ ./compile.sh

run:
$ ./sparse_algs1
