MPI codes for large scale sparse optimization
The provided codes use PETSc as a backbone for sparse matrix operations
Algorithms implemented in petsc_l1 folder.

To use:

Install petsc from http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/
check to make sure paths in setup_paths.sh match your system

source setup_paths.sh
make petsc_test1
make petsc_test_l1

run test programs: load matrix/vector, run optimization alg and record results to disk

./run_test1.sh
./run_test2.sh
